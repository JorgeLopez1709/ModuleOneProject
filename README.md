# Project Module One QA Manual Testing


## Description

This project focuses on creating test cases for the Todo.ly application's Project Creation module. As a tester hired by Todoly, your main task is to perform exploratory testing and familiarize yourself with the software. The module is already developed but lacks documentation. The goal is to cover the functional requirements specified by Todoly for the Project Creation module, including creating projects, changing project icons, renaming projects, and deleting projects. Additionally, within each project, tasks can be created, edited, deleted, have deadlines set, change task colors, and be moved.

The project utilizes the Exploratory Testing technique, which involves exploring and understanding the application, identifying possible scenarios, documenting them, and then testing them. The aim is to ensure the functionality and reliability of the Todo.ly application's Project Creation module.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/JorgeLopez1709/ModuleOneProject.git`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Configure the necessary settings for your test environment.
4. Run the test scripts.

## Test Cases

The test cases have been designed to cover the functional requirements specified by Todoly. The test cases prioritize high-level scenarios and detailed low-level test cases. The high-level test cases provide an overview of the test scenarios, while the low-level test cases provide comprehensive steps to execute the tests.

For more detailed information about each test case, please refer to the attached Excel sheets in the repository.

## Automation

Automation for the test cases has been implemented using Selenium WebDriver with C#. The test scripts leverage the knowledge acquired during Module 2 of the course. The project structure follows best practices for maintainability and reusability.
